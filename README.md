Ideas, resources, learning and development

Something new and exciting! I'm Bartek and I'm planning to take up a job as programmer. 
Started a while ago with little comitment but as I go deeper and deeper, 
and simultaneously my some-what dissapointment in my current discipline grows, 
I start dreaming bigger.

Started with Java at Udemy (thank you Tim Buchalka!) and will see where the road leads me.
